## `LenderPool`

### `constructor(address stableAddress_, uint16 stableAPY_)` (public)

### `setMinimumDeposit(uint256 _minimumDeposit)` (external)

changes the minimum amount required for deposit (newRound)

update `minimumDeposit` with `_minimumDeposit`

### `newRound(address lender, uint256 amount, uint16 bonusAPY, uint8 tenure, bool paidTrade)` (external)
